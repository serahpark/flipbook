# Flipbook!
By Serah Park

## Description
I created a flipbook app, given a package Cow.java containing classes for 2D and 3D vectors and building an application loop. This flipbook app was written in Java as part of a lab assignment for CSCI 136 at Williams College. In this app, users can draw many individual frames with their mouse and assemble an animation that will loop through all frames. Stay tuned for some updated features, such as onion skinning (which allows users to see what they drew a couple frames back or forward), undoing strokes, or changing pen colors!

## How to play
To play, download both files and run flipbook.java. All the instructions will be printed to the terminal, such as the keys the user can press to switch between frames or play the animation.
